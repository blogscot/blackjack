# Blackjack

This is my implementation of [Gophercise Exercise 10](https://gophercises.com/). In addition, I have incorporated a number of test cases to verify the correct operation of the game.

The game is two player only, a single human versus the dealer. Players can 'hit' or 'stand'. So far there is no feature to place wagers.

To start a game, type:

```
go run main/main.go
```
